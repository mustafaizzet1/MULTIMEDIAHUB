To ensure that the project works properly, use the following command.
1. `cd server`: Changes the current directory to the "server" directory.
2. `npm install`: Installs the dependencies for the server. This assumes that there is a `package.json` file in the "server" directory with the necessary dependencies listed.
3. `npm start`: Starts the server.

After setting up the server, the commands continue with:

4. `cd client`: Changes the current directory to the "client" directory.
5. `npm install`: Installs the dependencies for the client. Similar to the server, this assumes there is a `package.json` file in the "client" directory.
6. `npm start`: Starts the client.

These commands are common for setting up and running a server and client in a web development environment. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system for these commands to work, and also make sure that the necessary configuration files (`package.json` files) are present in the "server" and "client" directories.
